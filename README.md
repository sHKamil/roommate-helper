## Roommate Helper

This project was created to improve the organization of duties and supply mamnagement in the student apartment and beyond.

### Backend

Whole backend is based only on pure PHP without any framework, everything here was created from scratch: routing system, autoloader, token CSRF etc...
 
### About build

This project was build with docker so installation should be pretty easy however the docker configuration is prepared for server environment with multiple projects on it and its compatible with Caddy's reverse proxy.
